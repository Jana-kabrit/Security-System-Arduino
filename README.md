# Security-System-Arduino
The aim of this experiment is to design and simulate a circuit that checks a security system’s key. If the user inputs the right key, which is a combination of four numbers, ‘CORRECT You may enter’ is displayed. If the key is wrong, a ‘WRONG Try again’ is displayed, and if the wrong key is entered three times in a row, a ‘INTRUDER ALERT Locked out’ will be displayed with a buzzer going off. This will be done through coding an Arduino Uno that is connected to a keypad, LCD Screen, and buzzer. The code entered on the keypad will be displayed on the screen as the user is typing it. Finally, the simulation will be done on Tinker CAD.
